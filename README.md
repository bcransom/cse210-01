Week One
Tic Tac Toe Game

I made a first attempt at coding this game by myself. It was largely unsuccessful and I got lost. After looking at the possible solution provided in iLearn, and googling solutions (most of which were difficult to understand) I found a tutorial (https://bennettgarner.medium.com/the-tic-tac-toe-series-master-list-a4a908f015f9)to follow which helped explain each step. I started a new file to use with the tutorial to learn how to do this assignment. 
As a new update - I have been following the tutorial to complete this assignement and for the most part I understand what it is teaching. However, I did run into a section I don't understand, tuples. I also did not end up finishing the game before submitting. I don't want to just copy and paste to 'finish' the assignment, so I will be turning it in unfinished as I do not have more time to give today when it is due.
