Week One
Tic Tac Toe Game

I made a first attempt at coding this game by myself. It was largely unsuccessful and I got lost. After looking at the possible solution provided in iLearn, and googling solutions (most of which were difficult to understand) I found a tutorial to follow which helped explain each step. I started a new file to use with the tutorial to learn how to do this assignment.
